### Overview
This is the beginning of an app I have wanted to make for a long time. It's currently a catalogue of a couple of beers that I made up and some not made up. It is an app that displays important information about each beer such as the abv and a description of color and tasting notes. It will eventually be a platform to learn about different beers around the globe but also a central hub for homebrewers to share recipes.

### Lessons Learned
- First and formost. As in all programming, organization is key. There were several times I caught myself going down rabbit holes
or drifting off of task. It's so easy to get lost in such a project as this. I learned to be very specific and direct in tasking myself. I had to take notes and intentionally focus on one thing at time.
- Another lesson learned is that web development is a HUGE task. I am lucky enough to not struggle with time management, but I learned that what you think is going to take one hour, is really going to take 4 or maybe 5 hours. And a lot of times the issues you think you are going to have don't show up and the real issues are configuration and apps that you use update and change settings that reset something deeply embedded changed and you lost hours not even progressing forward.
